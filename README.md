# Couchbase on the AWS Cloud
This is the AWS QuickStart for Couchbase.  It contains a Cloud Formation Template (CFT) that creates Autoscaling Groups made up of Virtual Machines running the Couchbase AMIs for two products:

* Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition version 5.0.0
* Couchbase Sync Gateway Enterprise Edition version  1.5.0

The CFT also configures security groups and disks.

Before you launch the Quick Start, please review the architecture, configuration, network security, and other considerations discussed in the Deployment Guide.
