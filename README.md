## Deployment Options
This Quick Start reference deployment guide includes architectural considerations and configuration steps for deploying a Couchbase cluster on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. It discusses best practices for deploying Couchbase on AWS using services such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). It also provides links to automated AWS CloudFormation Templates (CFT) that you can leverage for your deployment or launch directly into your AWS account.

The guide is for IT infrastructure architects, administrators, and DevOps professionals who are planning to implement or extend their Couchbase workloads on the AWS cloud.

Before you launch the Quick Start, please review the architecture, configuration, network security, and other considerations discussed in this guide.
