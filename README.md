# quickstart-couchbase
## Couchbase on the AWS Cloud


This Quick Start automatically deploys Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition and Couchbase Sync Gateway Enterprise Edition into your Amazon Web Services (AWS) account.

Couchbase Server is a NoSQL database designed with a distributed architecture for performance, scalability, and availability. It enables developers to build applications by leveraging the power of SQL with the flexibility of JSON. 

The Quick Start offers two deployment options:

- Deploying Couchbase into a new virtual private cloud (VPC) that's configured for security, scalability, and high availability 
- Deploying Couchbase into an existing VPC in your AWS account

You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.

The deployment and configuration tasks are automated by AWS CloudFormation templates that you can customize during launch. The deployment guide provides architectural details and step-by-step deployment instructions.

For architectural details, step-by-step instructions, and customization options, see the [deployment guide](https://s3.amazonaws.com/quickstart-reference/couchbase/latest/doc/couchbase-on-the-aws-cloud.pdf).
